When conditions are bad, this model will alert drivers to remind them to be more careful, or to take a different route to their destination.\n\nIn most of the cases, not paying enough attention during driving, drug abuse or overspeeding are the main causes of serious accidents which would have been otherwise prevented by enacting harsher regulations. Several uncontrollable factors like the weather, visibility, or road conditions, etc are also contributing factors to a number of road accidents. These can be prevented by revealing hidden patterns in the data and warning to the local government, and notify the police and drivers traveling on those roads about the same. If these patterns are discovered early on, local government can know when to send alerts to the public and the respective authorities to drive more carefully or even avoid those roads entirely.\n\nThe target audience of the project is local Seattle government, police, rescue groups, and last but not least, car insurance institutes. The model and its results are going to provide some insights for the target audience to make important decisions for reducing the number of road accidents occuring in the city."

This data was collected by the Seattle Police Department(SPD) and the Traffic Records department of Seattle. The data has 37 independent variables and 194,673 records.\n\nWe will be using this data here to identify the key variables that may cause car accidents. For example, the \u201cWEATHER\u201d column may be used to show the types and number of accidents that occur for different weather conditions at the time of the accient. Furthermore, the \u201cINTKEY\u201d column can be grouped and the sum of the car accidents that happned at that paticular intersection can be known for all the intersections. This list can be sorted in descending order of the total sums to identify the most dangerous intersections, this data can be used by the respective authorities to provide better facilities and monitoring at that intersection. Finally, a supervised learning model will be used to come up with a formula that can predict the severity of an accident based on the inputs.\n\nOur predictor or target variable will be 'SEVERITYCODE' because it is used measure the severity of an accident from 0 to 5 within the dataset. Attributes used to weigh the severity of an accident are 'WEATHER', 'ROADCOND' and 'LIGHTCOND'. \u201cSEVERITYCODE\u201d contains numbers that correspond to different levels of severity caused by an accident from 0 to 4 which are as follows -\n\n0. Little to no Probability (Clear Conditions)\n1. Very Low Probability \u2014 Chance or Property Damage\n2. Low Probability \u2014 Chance of Injury\n3. Mild Probability \u2014 Chance of Serious Injury\n4. High Probability \u2014 Chance of Fatality"
